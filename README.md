# Flight Management - Frontend 

## Backend

Json-server is used to create a fake API and test fetch requests from the frontend using HTML and CSS with bootstrap. CRUD requests will be made, i.e. read, write, update and delete.

## Frontend

DOM elements are used to get the information from the forms for data input into the Json-server API and also to get the desired data. With the help of boostrap the web page is designed using styles for forms, buttons and div layout.
